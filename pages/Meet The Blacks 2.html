    As a result of surviving the events of the first film, 
    Carl Black moves his family back to Atlanta, 
    where he hopes to continue writing his new book. 
    As the Black family investigates their new neighbor, 
    Carl suspects he may be dealing with a vampire, Dr. Mamuwalde (Katt Williams).
